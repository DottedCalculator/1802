  The power you learned... I can feel it emanating from you.
  But that's enough talk. Let's get on with why you're here.
  As the Pokémon League Champion, I accept your challenge!

= Problems

Are you a person that plays every video game on hard mode? Yeah? I have a treat for you.

Anyway, more seriously, my hope you can use these problems to help prepare for Midterm 1,
even if you don't manage to solve them yourself.
I'd say: think about each for 15-30 minutes, then read the solution (following pages)
or come to office hours and I'll walk you through them.
I hope this helps you digest the course content since
I tried my best to craft problems that require deeper understanding
and piecing together multiple ideas, rather than just knowing one or two isolated recipes.

Solving with friends is encouraged; you'll have more fun thinking together.
Still, don't worry even if you solve 0 of the 6 problems;
these are harder than what will actually appear on the midterm.
The problems are sorted by the order the topics appeared in class (not by difficulty).

/ Problem 1.:
  In $RR^3$, compute the projection of the vector $vec(1,2,3)$ onto the plane $4x+5y+6z=0$.

/ Problem 2.:
  Suppose $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$ are points in $RR^3$.
  Give a geometric interpretation for this expression:
  $ (arrow(D A) times arrow(D B)) dot arrow(D C). $

/ Problem 3.:
  Fix a plane $cal(P)$ in $RR^3$ which passes through the origin.
  Consider the linear transformation $f : RR^3 -> RR^3$
  where $f(bf(v))$ is the projection of $bf(v)$ onto $cal(P)$.
  Let $M$ denote the $3 times 3$ matrix associated to $f$.
  Compute the determinant of $M$.

/ Problem 4.:
  Let $bf(a)$ and $bf(b)$ be two perpendicular unit vectors in $RR^3$.
  A third vector $bf(v)$ in $RR^3$ lies in the span of $bf(a)$ and $bf(b)$.
  Given that $bf(v) dot bf(a) = 7$ and $bf(v) dot bf(b) = 8$,
  compute the magnitudes of the cross products $bf(v) times bf(a)$ and $bf(v) times bf(b)$.

/ Problem 5.:
  Compute the trace of the $2 times 2$ matrix $M$ given the two equations
  $ M vec(4,7) = vec(5,9) " and " M vec(5,9) = vec(4,7). $

/ Problem 6.:
  There are three complex numbers $z$ satisfying $z^3 = 5 + 6 i$.
  Suppose we plot these three numbers in the complex plane.
  Compute the area of the triangle they enclose.
