  While challenging and improving the mathematical problem-solving skills of
  high-performing students are surely every-day objectives of those who teach such students,
  it is not a problem, relatively speaking, of major import in American education.

= Recitation questions from official course

/ 1.: Calculate the double integral of the function $f (x , y) = 6 x^2 + 2 y$
  over the rectangle $R = [0 , 2] times [- 1 , 1]$. Use both vertical and
  horizontal slicings and check you get the same answer.

/ 2.: Let $R$ be the first-quadrant region bounded by the two curves
  $y = sqrt(x)$ and $y = x^3$. Compute in two different ways the double
  integral $ integral int_R x y^2 dif A . $

/ 3.: Let $R$ be the (bounded) region between the parabola $y^2 = x$ and the
  line through $(2 , 0)$ having slope $1$. Find the points where the
  curves intersect and describe the region $R$ in terms of horizontal
  slices and vertical slices. Express the double integral
  $ iint_R f (x , y) dif A$ as an iterated integral in both
  ways, using both horizontal and vertical slicings.
  In the second case, you will have to write the integral in two pieces.
