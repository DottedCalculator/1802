= 18.02 Mock Midterm 3 Instructions

- Don't turn the page until the signal to start is given #todo[time].

- You have 50 minutes to answer five questions.
  We're not grading anything, so write your solutions anywhere
  (the space below, other loose paper, notebook, iPad, etc.).

- Like the real exam, I suggest not referring to any notes/calculators/etc.

- Solutions are posted in Section #todo[?] of my LAMV book at #url("https://web.evanchen.cc/1802.html").
