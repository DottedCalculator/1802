== Solution to @exer-work-1

The vector field is conservative, because
$ partial / (partial y) (x^2 - y) = -1 = partial / (partial x) (y^2 - x). $
So the answer is $0$.
(If you didn't notice this at first and tried to use Green's theorem,
you should notice at the moment where the curl turns out to $0$.)
