#exerstar[
  - Give an example of a differentiable function $f : RR^2 -> RR$ with the following property:
    for every point $(x,y)$, the point $(x,y)$ is a saddle point if and only if
    $x$ and $y$ are both integers.
  - Does there exist a differentiable function $f : RR^2 -> RR$
    such that every point is a saddle point?
