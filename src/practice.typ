Some practice questions from topics through the entire course.

#exer[
  Find the unique $2 times 2$ matrix $A$ for which
  $vec(1,1)$ is an eigenvector with eigenvalue $3$
  and $vec(2,1)$ is an eigenvector with eigenvalue $4$.
]

#exer[
  Let $cal(S)$ be the level surface of $f(x,y,z) = e^x + e^(2y) + e^(3z)$
  that passes through the origin.
  Find all real numbers $t$ such that the vector $angle.l t+4, t+5, t+6 angle.r$
  is tangent to $cal(S)$ at the origin.

#exer[
  Let $cal(R)$ denote the region in the $x y$-plane cut out by
  $y = x + 2$, $y = x + 20$, and $y = x^2$.
  Compute the area of $cal(R)$.
