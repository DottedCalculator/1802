= Double and triple integrals

== [TEXT] The different flavors of integrals

The rest of 18.02 is going to cover a bunch of different integrals.
If you've been following my advice to pay attention to type safety so far, it'll help you here.
I'll freely admit that I (Evan) often make type-errors in this part of 18.02 as well,
so don't let your guard down.
