= Double and triple integrals

== [TEXT] The different flavors of integrals

The rest of 18.02 is going to cover a bunch of different integrals.
If you've been following my advice to pay attention to type safety so far,
this would be a good time to start.
To put it in perspective,
even I (Evan) have a hard time keeping track of type signatures in this part of 18.02.
So if you constantly find yourself having to look up type signatures in this part of 18.02,
you are going to be in great company.

$oiint_1^4 f(x)$
