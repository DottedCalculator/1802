= Triple integrals <sec-triple>

We're going to now consider integrals with three variables, rather than two.
If you understood double integrals, then triple integrals is more of the same:

  All the two-variable stuff ports over to three-variable stuff in the obvious way.

== [RECAP] Recap of triple integrals

I'm cheekily calling this section a "recap" to emphasize that there's nothing new to learn here.
Everything in the below list corresponds to a double integral thing you learned
except with two variables rather than three.

- Over a rectangular prism,
  we still integrate $int_(x = a_1)^(b_1) int_(y = a_2)^(b_2) int_(z = a_3)^(b_3) f(x,y,z) dif z dif y dif x$
  one variable at a time.
- You can use $ dif V := dif x dif y dif z $ as a shorthand if you want;
  this is the last row of @table-shorthand.
- Instead of $x y$ integration we have $x y z$-integration.
  Whereas for double integrations you had two choices ($x$ outer and $y$ inner vs. $y$ outer and $x$ inner),
  now you have $3! = 6$ choices for the order to do things in:
  - $x$ outermost, $y$ middle, $z$ inner
  - $x$ outermost, $z$ middle, $y$ inner
  - $y$ outermost, $x$ middle, $z$ inner
  - $y$ outermost, $z$ middle, $x$ inner
  - $z$ outermost, $x$ middle, $y$ inner
  - $z$ outermost, $y$ middle, $x$ inner.
  The idea is the same if you have a region that isn't a rectangular prism:
  write your region as inequalities.
- The change of variables formula is exactly the same, where the Jacobian is now a $3 times 3$ matrix:
  if $bf(T) : cal(S) -> cal(R)$ is a transition map of 3D regions, sending $(u,v,w)$ to $(x,y,z)$,
  then the Jacobian is
  $ J_(bf(T)) = mat(
      (partial u) / (partial x), (partial v) / (partial x), (partial w) / (partial x);
      (partial u) / (partial y), (partial v) / (partial y), (partial w) / (partial y);
      (partial u) / (partial z), (partial v) / (partial z), (partial w) / (partial z);
    ). $
- Volume is $ op("Vol")(cal(R)) := iiint_(cal(R)) dif x dif y dif z. $
  You can take this as a _definition_ of volume for this class.
- If $rho : cal(R) -> RR$ is a density function for a 3D space, then
  $ op("Mass")(cal(R)) := iiint_(cal(R)) rho(x,y,z) dif x dif y dif z $ is the total mass.
- The center of mass is given by three coordinates now:
  $ (
    (iiint_(cal(R)) x dot rho(x,y,z) dif x dif y dif z) / (op("Mass")(cal(R))),
    (iiint_(cal(R)) y dot rho(x,y,z) dif x dif y dif z) / (op("Mass")(cal(R))),
    (iiint_(cal(R)) z dot rho(x,y,z) dif x dif y dif z) / (op("Mass")(cal(R)))
  ). $
