# Contributing

Please submit [pull requests](https://github.com/vEnhance/1802/pulls)!
Things that you can help with:

1. Find some typos! There are plenty. This book is new and still being tested.
2. Draw some more figures. The figures are made in Asymptote, check the
   `figures/` directory.
3. Help fill in solutions to the exercises or flesh out things marked with
   the `#todo` tag.
4. Suggest new exercises for the text, especially interesting ones.
5. Anything else, really.

For minor typo fixes, you can probably just use the GitHub web editor
to generate the pull request,
so you don't have to download anything.

If you want to make more involved changes,
you probably want to `git clone` a local copy of the repository.
See [README.md](README.md) for some instructions on installation.
